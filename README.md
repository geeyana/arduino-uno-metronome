## ðŸ“‹ Overview 
This project was part of the BC/CSUB Summer Research Experience between Bakersfield College and California State University, Bakersfield. In this program, participants will identify a problem of interest to them and propose an inventive hardware solution. The next steps will be to design, fabricate, and test the proposed invention. This will be an iterative process, which will involve 3D printing, laser cutting, and electronics. Participants will design and build everything from scratch, and consequently learn a lot in the process. The program starts with learning about the available tools for fabrication and discussions on the proposed ideas. Then, the participants will spend a few weeks on developing their inventions. At the end, the participants are expected to present their work in the form of a poster.

This metronome is inspired by [another Arduino metronome project](https://projecthub.arduino.cc/mircemk/diy-simple-arduino-metronome-eabd20). The code here is modified to suit the different materials used. Here is [a video demonstration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OBexGvnXHa3EdNXaehNujgZdV5Elhmtf/view) of our build in action.
