# Arduino UNO Metronome

This project was a result of a summer research internship opportunity.

Inspired by [another Arduino metronome project](https://projecthub.arduino.cc/mircemk/diy-simple-arduino-metronome-eabd20). The code here is modified to suit the different materials used. Here is [a video demonstration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OBexGvnXHa3EdNXaehNujgZdV5Elhmtf/view).

## Features
- Six pushbuttons: ±1, ±5, ±10 BPM
- Eight LEDs flashing in an analog metronome style
- Two piezo buzzers to sound each beat
- An LCD screen to display the BPM
